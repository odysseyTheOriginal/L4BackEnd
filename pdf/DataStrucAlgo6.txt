Define Levels



Length of a path is one less than the number of
nodes in a path.



Node to Node(itself) – length of path is zero



Height of a node – length of the longest path from
node to a leaf.



Height of a tree – the height of the root node.



Depth of a node – length of the path from the root
to that node.

Recursive Definition

Tree Traversal


Methods of visiting(processing) each node in
the tree exactly one time.
