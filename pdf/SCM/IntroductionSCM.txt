Supply Chain Management
• Strategic, tactical and operating issues
– Strategic - long term and dealing with supply chain design
• Determining the number, location and capacity of facilities
• Make or buy decisions
• Forming strategic alliances

– Tactical - intermediate term
• Determining inventory levels
• Quality-related decisions
• Logistics decisions

– Operating - near term
• Production planning and control decisions
• Goods and service delivery scheduling
• Some make or buy decisions

Supply Chain Management
• Key issues in supply chain management include
– Distribution network configuration
•
•
•
•

How many warehouses do we need?
Where should these warehouses be located?
What should the production levels be at each of our plants?
What should the transportation flows be between plants and
warehouses?

– Inventory control
• Why are we holding inventory? Uncertainty in customer demand?
Uncertainty in the supply process? Some other reason?
• If the problem is uncertainty, how can we reduce it?
• How good is our forecasting method?

Supply Chain Management
– Distribution strategies
• Direct shipping to customers?
• Classical distribution in which inventory is held in warehouses and then
shipped as needed?
• Cross-docking in which transshipment points are used to take stock from
suppliers’ deliveries and immediately distribute to point of usage?

– Supply chain integration and strategic partnering
•
•
•
•

Should information be shared with supply chain partners?
What information should be shared?
With what partners should information be shared?
What are the benefits to be gained?

Supply Chain Management
– Product design
• Should products be redesigned to reduce logistics costs?
• Should products be redesigned to reduce lead times?
• Would delayed differentiation be helpful?

– Information technology and decision-support systems
•
•
•
•

What data should be shared (transferred)
How should the data be analyzed and used?
What infrastructure is needed between supply chain members?
Should e-commerce play a role?

– Customer value
• How is customer value created by the supply chain?
• What determines customer value? How do we measure it?
• How is information technology used to enhance customer value in the
supply chain?

Supply Chain Management
• How can you assess how well your supply chain is
performing?
– The SCOR model - Supply Chain Operations Reference Model developed by the Supply Chain Council can be used to assess
performance
– SCOR model metrics include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

On-time delivery performance
Lead time for order fulfillment
Fill rate - proportion of demand met from on-hand inventory
Supply chain management cost
Warranty cost as a percentage of revenue
Total inventory days of supply
Net asset turns

Supply Chain Management
• Creating an effective supply chain
– Develop strategic objectives and tactics
– Integrate and coordinate activities in the internal portion of the supply
chain
– Coordinate activities with suppliers and customers
– Coordinate planning and execution across the supply chain
– Consider forming strategic partnerships

SCM - Inventory Management Issues
• Manufacturers would like to produce in large lot sizes because it is
more cost effective to do so. The problem, however, is that
producing in large lots does not allow for flexibility in terms of
product mix.
• Retailers find benefits in ordering large lots such as quantity
discounts and more than enough safety stock.
• The downside is that ordering/producing large lots can result in
large inventories of products that are currently not in demand
while being out of stock for items that are in demand.

What are Global Value Chains?

Global Value Chains (GVCs) include the full range of
activities that are required to bring a product from its
conception to its end use and beyond (e.g. design,
production, distribution). Value chain activities can be
contained within a single firm or divided among different
firms, and can be contained within a single geographical
location or spread over wider areas.
(Gereffi, Humphrey, Sturgeon, Global Value Chains Initiative,
www.globalvaluechains.org/concepts/index.html, 2006)

Global Value Chains: A New Paradigm for all Firms
 Globalization trends are placing particular pressure on industries offering
both opportunities and challenges

 Fast growing emerging markets
 Increasingly global competition for talent and
innovation
 Rise of intermediate trade reinforces the need for global connection

 Firms are increasingly fragmenting their production
processes and spreading them around the world
 GVCs are about a lot more than developing foreign markets

 Foreign affiliates no longer only serve local markets
 Global transactions and partnerships seen as key to
access skills, inputs, technology and other opportunities

Challenge is to be involved in high value-added, high impact sectors...

Key questions raised by Global Value Chains

 What business functions are establishments doing internally and externally
(outsourcing)?

 What business functions are establishments doing domestically and abroad
(offshoring)?
 What types of jobs go with various business functions, including employment by
occupation, wages, tenure, and number and type of new hires in past 12months?
 What educational and training requirements are associated with various business
function combinations?
 How do the business functions that an establishment engages in relate to the goods
and services bought and sold (inputs and outputs)?
 How do the business functions that an establishment engages in relate to its
economic performance (market share, profitability, employment, share of value
added, market share)
 How do the mix of business functions in firms compare to establishments in other
countries?
