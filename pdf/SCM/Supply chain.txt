Single – Industry Firm
To gain competitive advantage a firm may choose to
configure its activities and operations so that it can
produce products or services that are viewed as being
of comparable value to those of competitors, but to do
so at less cost.

Consider the components of the value chain. Do any provide
the potential to generate competitive advantage?

The Value Chain Model developed by Michael Porter can be
used to identify significant value added components. A value
chain is a systematic way of viewing the series of activities a
firm performs to provide a product to its customers.
The value chain disaggregates a firm into its strategically
relevant activities in order to understand the behaviour of the
firm’s cost and its existing or potential sources of
differentiation.
A firm gains competitive advantage by performing these
strategically important activities ( Key external factors) more
cheaply or better than competitors

Every firm can be viewed as a collection of value activities
that are performed to design, produce, market, deliver, and
support its product.

The Value Chain Model

g & Sales

Service

These activities can be grouped into nine basic categories .
Within each category of activity, a firm typically performs a
number of discrete activities that may represent key Ss and Ws
for the firm.
Through the systematic identification of these discrete activities, managers
using the value chain approach can target potential Ss & Ws for further
evaluation.
The basic categories of activities can be grouped into two broad types

Primary Activities: Activities involved in the physical creation
of the firm’s product or services, its delivery and marketing to the
buyer and its after sale support.
* Inbound Logistics : Activities associated with receiving, storing,
and disseminating inputs to the product, such as material
handling,warehousing, inventory control, vehicle scheduling and
returns to suppliers.
* Operations: Activities associated with transforming inputs into
the final product form such as machining, packaging, assembly,
equipment maintenance, testing, printing and facility operations.

Outbound logistics : Activities associated with
collecting,storing, and physically distributing the product to
buyers such as finished goods warehousing, material handling,
delivery vehicle operation, order processing, and scheduling.
Marketing and sales : Activities associated with providing a
means by which buyers can purchase the product and inducing
them to do so.
Services : Activities associated with providing service to
enhance or maintain the values of the product such as
installation, repair. Training, parts supply, and product
adjustment.
Support Activities : Provide inputs or infrastructure allowing the
primary activities to take place on an on going basis.
Procurement: Activities involved in obtaining purchased
inputs, whether raw materials, purchased services,
machinery, or so on .

Technology development : Activities involved in designing the
product as well as in creating and improving the way the
various activities in the value chain are performed.

Human resources Management: Activities necessary to
ensure the recruiting, training and development of
personnel. Every activity involves human resources.

Firm Infrastructure: Such activities as general
Management, accounting, legal finance, strategic
planning, and all others decoupled from specific primary
or support activities but essential to the entire chain’s
operation

Not all of the value chain activities are important to competitive
advantage in every industry.
A very important component of the value chain concept is the
notion of linkages. The value chain of a firm is composed of a
networked system of interdependent activities connected by
linkages. Whenever an activity affects the cost or effectiveness
of another activity, linkage between the two activities occurs.

Whenever linkage occurs, coordination between the activities
is necessary and trade offs between the two activities will be
needed to optimize the outcome.
An important key to competitive advantage lies in a firm’s
ability to perceive its activities as a system, rather than a
collection of independent activities and its ability to manage
its value chain as a system.

Logistics vs Supply Chain Management

 Does logistics different from SCM?
 Which concept is much more broader?
 Which concept is more modern?
 Which concept is salient?

Logistics vs SCM
Origin of Logistics
The concept of “Logistics”started many years before Christ and was used
by Greek generals (Leon the Wise, Alexander the Great) in order to
describe all the procedures for the army’s procurement on food,
clothing, ammunition, etc.
Alexander the Great was a big fan of the mobility of his troops and he
didn’t want his troops to stay in one place waiting for supplies from
Macedonia. Thus, he tried to resolve the issues of supplies by using
supplies from the local resources of his defeated enemies.

Logistics vs SCM
Origin of Logistics
For many years, logistics were always an issue in war affairs.
Kingdoms and generals with strategic planning on logistics were
those who won the war.
World War II was the major motivation of logistics to increase
recognition and emphasis
Starting from the early ‘60s, many factors, such as deregulation,
competitive pressures, information technology, globalization,
profit leverage, etc., contributed to the increase of logistics science
in the form we now it today.

Logistics vs SCM
Logistics management tries to have the “right product”, in
the “right quantity”, at the “right place”, at the “right
time”, with the “right cost”
One quite widely accepted view shows the relationship as
shows:

Logistics = Supply + Materials management +
Distribution

Logistics vs SCM
Logistics Management
The Process of planning, implementing and
controlling the efficient, cost-effective flow
and storage of raw materials, in-process
inventory, finished goods, and related
information flow from point-of-origin to
point-of-consumption for the purpose of
conforming to customer requirements

Globalization has changed the way firms do business…

 Since the end of WWII, the importance of trade and

international investment has grown steadily.

 Large multinational firms have become the main players in

all major sectors.

 Through FDI and international mergers and acquisitions,

they were able to jump tariff barriers and tap into natural
resources, labour, and technology, around the world.

 Production chains were traditionally vertically integrated,

i.e. multinational firms owned an entire production process.

GSCs are becoming increasingly important – a vedio
 GSCs have existed as long as trade in intermediate

products has taken place, but they are now increasingly
important.
 World exports and FDI outward stock has been growing

faster than global GDP
 Foreign affiliates (FA) no longer only engage in serving

local markets in host countries but often export more
than host country domestic firms

… giving rise to GSCs as a more established way of doing
business.
 In recent years, we have seen a change in how firms organize

their production into global supply chains:
 Firms are increasingly outsourcing some of their activities to
third-parties.

 They are locating parts of their supply chain outside their

home country (offshoring)

 They are increasingly partnering with other firms through

strategic alliances and joint ventures.

 Smaller firms and suppliers are now becoming global
 These new business strategies have allowed firms to specialize

on “core” competencies (vertical specialization) to sustain
their competitive advantage.

Offshoring is gaining importance…
 Companies now offshore

more activities, both in
terms of size and scope
 Business process

outsourcing (BPO) and
information technology
(IT) services are supplied
from a large number of
locations
 Some firms also offshore

other high-knowledge
activities such as R&D.

The objectives of Global Supply Chains

Two main objectives could be identified:


Prompt and reliable delivery of high-quality
products and services at the least cost.



To effectively meet rising customer
expectations.

Activity
 Say we get an order from a European retailer to produce

10,000 garments. For this customer we might decide to buy
yarn from a Korean producer but have it woven and dyed in
Taiwan. So we pick the yarn and ship it to Taiwan. The
Japanese have the best zippers … so we go to YKK, a big
Japanese zipper manufacturer, and we order the right
zippers from their Chinese plants. …the best place to make
the garments is Thailand. So we ship everything there.
…the customer needs quick delivery, we may divide the order
across five factories in Thailand. Effectively, we are
customizing the value chain to best meet the customer’s
needs. (Interview of Victor Fung of Li & Fung in HBR,
Sept-Oct 1998.)

Supply Chain Management
 Supply chain management deals with linking the

organizations within the supply chain in order to meet
demand across the chain as efficiently as possible. In our
example, Li & Fung is creating and managing the links. In
non-brokered supply chains, one or more of the chain’s
organizations can provide the management function.
 Why is supply chain management so important?
 To gain efficiencies from procurement, distribution and logistics
 To make outsourcing more efficient
 To reduce transportation costs of inventories

 To meet competitive pressures from shorter development times,

more new products, and demand for more customization

Supply Chain Management
 To meet the challenge of globalization and longer supply chains
 To meet the new challenges from e-commerce

 To manage the complexities of supply chains
 To manage the inventories needed across the supply chain

 Why is supply chain management difficult?
 Different organizations in the supply chain may have different,

conflicting objectives






Manufacturers: long run production, high quality, high productivity,
low production cost
Distributors: low inventory, reduced transportation costs, quick
replenishment capability
Customers: shorter order lead time, high in-stock inventory, large
variety of products, low prices

 Supply chains are dynamic - they evolve and change over time

Supply Chain Management
 Supply chains and vertical integration
 For any organization vertical integration involves either taking on

more of the supplier activities (backward) and/or taking on more of
the distribution activities (forward)
 An example of backward vertical integration would be a peanut

butter manufacturer that decides to start growing peanuts rather
than buying peanuts from a supplier
 An example of forward vertical integration would be a peanut butter

manufacturer that decides to start marketing their peanut better
directly to grocery stores
 In supply chains, some of the supplying and some of the

distribution might be performed by the manufacturer

Supply Chain Management
 The significance of vertical integration in the supply chain is that

the activities that are performed by the manufacturer are typically
more easily managed than those which are performed by other
organizations

 Therefore, the degree of vertical integration can have an impact on

the structure and relationships between members of a supply chain

Supply Chain Management
 How can you assess how well your supply chain is

performing?
 The SCOR model - Supply Chain Operations Reference Model -

developed by the Supply Chain Council (http://www.supplychain.org/) can be used to assess performance
 SCOR model metrics include:






On-time delivery performance
Lead time for order fulfillment
Fill rate - proportion of demand met from on-hand inventory
Supply chain management cost
Warranty cost as a percentage of revenue
Total inventory days of supply
Net asset turns

Supply Chain Management
 Creating an effective supply chain
 Develop strategic objectives and tactics

 Integrate and coordinate activities in the internal portion of the

supply chain
 Coordinate activities with suppliers and customers
 Coordinate planning and execution across the supply chain
 Consider forming strategic partnerships

SCM - Inventory Management Issues
 Manufacturers would like to produce in large lot sizes

because it is more cost effective to do so. The problem,
however, is that producing in large lots does not allow for
flexibility in terms of product mix.
 Retailers find benefits in ordering large lots such as

quantity discounts and more than enough safety stock.
 The downside is that ordering/producing large lots can

result in large inventories of products that are currently
not in demand while being out of stock for items that are
in demand.
