• Uninterrupted flows of raw materials at the lowest total cost, to
improve quality of the finished goods produced, and to optimize
customer satisfaction.

• How to achieve the objectives?
• Seek better materials,
• Reliable suppliers,
• working closely with and exploiting the expertise of strategic
suppliers to improve the quality of RM

The Purchasing Process
• Draft the manual process of purchasing in a
company/organization

Small Value Purchase Orders
• Extra burden to purchasing managers - Administrative costs and order
cycle time
• What strategies can be implemented to overcome these issues?

Small Value Purchase Orders
• Extra burden to purchasing managers - Administrative costs and order
cycle time
• Alternatives
• Procurement credit cards/Corporate purchasing cards
• Blank Cheque Purchase Orders
• Blanket or Open-End Purchase Orders – covers a variety or items and is
negotiated for repeated supply over a fixed time period such as
quarterly or yearly
• Open-end PO – additional items and expiration dates can be
renegotiated.
• Stockless Buying or System Contracting – suppliers should maintain the
minimum inventory level
• Petty cash
• Standardization and Simplification of Materials and Components
• Accumulating and Small Orders to Create a Large Order
• Using a Fixed order interval for specific categories of
materials/supplies

Sourcing Decisions: The Make-or-Buy
Decisions
• Outsourcing – buying materials and components from
suppliers instead of making them in-house.
• In past – prefer make option using backward or forward
integration
• Not all functions can be outsourced – mostly core in in-house
• Reasons for buying or outsourcing

Cost advantages
Insufficient capacity
Lack of expertise
Quality

• Reasons for making
•
•
•
•

•

Protect proprietary technology
No competent supplier
Better quality control
Use existing idle capacity
Control of lead-time, transportation and warehousing cost
Lower cost

Role of Supply Base
• Strategic Role of suppliers
• Suppliers not only provides products/supplies but also;
• Product and process technology and knowledge to support the
buyer’s operations, particularly in product design – supplier
involvement
• Information on trends, processes, designs
• Information on supply market – shortages, price increases,
political situations - may threaten supplies of vital materials
• Capacity for meeting unexpected demand
• Cost efficiency due to economies of scale, since the supplier is
likely to produce the same item for multiple buyers

Supplier Selection

Potential challenges for global
sourcing
• Global sourcing increased due to improvement of
communication and transportation technologies, reduction of
internal trade barriers, deregulation of transportation industry
