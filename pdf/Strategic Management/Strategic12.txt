Strategy Means Trade-offs

offers
• It is essential, otherwise:
• Inconsistencies in image or reputation
• Requirement of different setting (due to less flexibility in systems etc.)
• Limits on internal coordination and control

What Strategy is Not About
• Not Operational Effectiveness
• Operational Effectiveness is a part of it
• It leads to being similar (while strategy seeks to being different)

• Strategy is not technology
• Never let technology lead strategy

Strategic Thinking
• Think in a different way
• Look for alternatives
• For instance, 10 answers for each problem

• Crack your thinking
• We tend to repeat the past; same thinking pattern, same behavior etc. We
always try to solve the tomorrow’s problem with the yesterday’s solution
• Tend to go by the trend
• Paradigm paralysis

• Move to the edges of existing paradigms to initiate shifts.
• Identify the boarders of our box; get out of it
