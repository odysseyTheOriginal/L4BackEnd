distribution system powered by unique software?
• Do you have employees with unique skills and capabilities?

Common Method for Analysis
• Consider a context / scenario for the analysis
• E.g. internal resource capabilities, consumer value delivery efficiency

• Identify the determinants (factors determining / defining the context)
• Assign a weight to reflect the relative importance among the factors
• Assign values that are reflective of the current status of each factor for the
organization
• Assign values that are reflective of the current status of each factor for the
major competitors
• Obtain the scores to determine the relative competitive position of the
company against its competitors
