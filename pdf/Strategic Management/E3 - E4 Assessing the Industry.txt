The Five Forces
Model

Porter M (2008), The Five Competitive
Forces that shapes strategy, Harvard
Business Review, 2008

The Model in nutshell
• Profitability has nothing to do with the “sexiness”
of the industry
• Industry’s profits are shared not only among rivals
• How the possible generated “profit” in the industry
is shared among the players of the “game”
• An industry generates a certain amount of
possible profits. Who eats what portion is what
determines the leftover for the organization
So, there are forces of the industry that will unlimitedly determine
the profitability of the that industry

Threat of new entrants
• Supply-side economies of scale
• Demand-side benefits of scale

Does the industry require
special something to
operate….that you are
only one or few of them
who has it?

• “Network effect” Large number of users
use it

•
•
•
•

Capital requirements
Switching costs
Government Policy
Expected retaliation from existing
players

Bargaining Power
• When customer has many options
• Customer contributes to significant
portion of sales (B2B)
• Low switching cost
• Availability of information
• Threat of back-wards integration
(B2B)
• Undifferentiated product
• No significant effect on the
organizations value generation
process (B2B)
Department of Interdisciplinary Studies

Will the customer
ask for more
(quality, options,
terms) for little in
exchange?

Substitutes
• Is there any option for the same market with better /
improved version of price-performance trade off

Does this change the
value proposition at the
customer?
Does the customer get
a better deal?

Department of Interdisciplinary Studies

13

Power of suppliers
• Few strong players
• Few substitutes for the buyer (organization)
• Provide special knowledge or feature of that is
important for the organizations’ value delivery
• Poses a threat of forward integrations

How many
options are there?

Competition among players
• Slow growth industry….less chance for
differentiation
• High fixed cost….so need to have more sales to
cover fixed cost
• High exit barriers…”now I cannot get out from this”
• Lack of understanding about the consumers

Department of Interdisciplinary Studies

Strategic Group Map
• To identify group of competitors having similar
strategies and actions
• Plot against competitive characteristics like price, target
segments, level of integration, etc
• Size of circle denotes market share
