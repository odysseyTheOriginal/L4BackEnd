Misconceptions about
Motivation

Why is Motivation Important?
• Under optimal conditions, effort can often be increased and 
sustained

* Current generation has no work ethic
* Some people are born “lazy”
* Most people are motivated by the same thing

• Delegation without constant supervision is always necessary
• Employees can become self-motivated
• Motivated employees can provide competitive advantage by 
offering suggestions & working to satisfy customers

What is Motivation 

Bottom Line

The process by which a person’s efforts are energized,
directed and sustained toward attaining a goal.

Motivation is accomplishing things
through the efforts of others. If 
you cannot do this, you will fail as a
manager.

Energy- how hard 
Direction- towards organizational goals
 Persistence- continuous effort

“Issues” with Maslow’s Need Model 

Behavior leading to self-actualization:
(a) Experiencing life like a child, with full absorption 
and concentration;

1. Few needs can arise at the same time, not a
hierarchy

(b) Trying new things instead of sticking to safe paths;
(c) Listening to your own feelings in evaluating 
experiences instead of the voice of tradition, authority
or the majority;

2. Some may only have 2-3 need hierarchy
3. All will not motivate in same manner

(d) Avoiding pretense and being honest;
(e) Taking responsibility and working hard;

2. ERG Theory - Alderfer 

ERG Theory ………………
There are three groups of core needs;

Need 
Progression

Growth Needs 

Need 
Regression
 Core Needs:
Existence: provision of basic
 material requirements.

Relatedness Needs 

Relatedness: desire for 
relationships. 
Growth: desire for personal 
development. 

Concepts:
More than one need can be
operative at the same time. 
If a higher-level need cannot be
fulfilled, the desire to satisfy a
lower-level need increases.

Existence Needs

 Two Factor Theory…….

3. Two Factor Theory - Herzberg
 Herzberg’s Theory rests on two assumptions;
1.) Being satisfied with one’s job is equivalent 
to being motivated;
(“a satisfied worker is a motivated worker”)

2.) No satisfaction 

dissatisfaction

THE GOALS OF COGNITIVE
THEORIES ARE TO EXPLAIN
THOUGHTS ABOUT EFFORT:

Cognitive Theories

1.) the decision to make an effort
2.) the level of effort to exert
3.) how effort can be made to persist over time 

21

22

1. Expectancy Theory 

Expectancy Theory………..

Involves 3 cognitions/perceptions:
1. Expectancy -

the perceived probability that effort will 
lead to task performance. E link

2. Instrumentality -

the perceived probability that 
performance will lead to rewards. I link

3. Valence -

the anticipated value of a particular 
outcome to an individual.

2. Equity Theory

Implications for Managers

What is the basis of equity theory?

• Need to offer employees valued rewards (high 
valences)
• Need to ensure that if people are willing to put for th
e ffort that you help them succeed. Maintain the E
link (Provide tools, info, support)

• People decide on putting effort only after a
social comparison with a reference person.

• Need to make sure that you follow through with 
reward system that is tied to performance. Maintain
the I link (Differential rewards for performance)
26

25

Equity Theory: The decision to exert effort is a function
of social comparison
 Involves 3 relevant perceptions:

• Employees mentally construct outcome-to-input
ratios for themselves and their referent and
“socially compare”
• If equity exists, you experience no tension and
persist at your current level of effort
• When Outcome Self =/= Outcome Reference person

1. Perceptions of outcomes received from performing a task.
(e.g., pay)
2. Perceptions of inputs required to perform a task.
3. Perceptions of the outcomes and inputs of a REFERENCE
PERSON.
If: Outcomes Self

 Outcomes Reference Person
=

Inputs Self 

Inputs Reference Person 

Then equity exists.

How does equity theory works ?

27 

Input Self 
Input Reference person 
Tension is created and employees are 
“motivated” to restore equity 

Restoring

Equity Theory 
Equitable Situation:
 Outcomes Self 
Job Inputs Self

28

Equity
=

Outcomes Reference Person
Job Inputs Reference Person

Under-reward:
Increase outcomes 
Reduce inputs

 Inequitable Situations:

Over-reward:

A. Under-reward or “Cheated” (from Self’s point of view)
Outcomes/Inputs Self 4/5

<

Outcomes/Inputs Reference Person 5/5

B. Over-reward or “Guilty” (from Self’s point of view)
Outcomes/Inputs Self 5/4

>

Other Options:

Outcomes/Inputs Reference Person 5/5

C. Either way, a person is “motivated” to restore equity 

Increase inputs 
Reduce Outcomes (?)

3. Goal Setting Theory 
Reasoning behind goal setting;
Direction - specific goals direct your focus to relevant 
activities
 Effort - need to devote more intense levels of effort
 toward difficult goals - assumes people are goal driven

 Reinforcement/operant 
conditioning

 Persistence - specific, difficult goals encourage you to
persist longer at a task than would be the case without
such goals
 Only possible exception is
high “uncertainty avoidance”
 cultures.
31 

Reinforcement Theory of Motivation
• Some view as an explanation of motivation; others 
limit it to how motivation is sustained over time.
• Does not have to rely on needs, perceptions or
cognitions. Managers can design work environment
 to provide “reinforcers” that strengthen desired
behaviors & weaken undesired behaviors.

32

Motivation as a Form of Learning:
The Law of Effect
• Behavior that leads toward rewards tends to be 
repeated 
• Behavior that tends to lead toward no rewards or
towards punishment tends to be avoided

 The type of reinforcement & the timing
(schedule) of reinforcement are key

• “Motivation is a function of the environment”.

33

 Reinforcers Which Strengthen Behavior: What managers 
can do to increase the probability of behavior in the future
a. Positive reinforcement--rewards contingent on
exhibiting the correct behavior.

34 

Reinforcers Which Weaken Behavior: What 
managers can do to decrease the probability of behavior in the
future
a. Punishment--administering unpleasant 
consequences
 following an undesirable behavior.

b. Negative reinforcement—withholding something 
unpleasant when a desired behavior is engaged in (e.g., an
annoying alarm is avoided when a machine is used properly,
not operating in reverse). Or, using social learning, noticing
how engaging in some behavior avoids an unpleasant
outcome.
(e.g., arrive on time and then boss does not shout).
35

b. Extinction--when there are no rewards for a
behavior which was previously rewarded. 

36

 Partial Reinforcement Schedules 

Timing of Reinforcement

1. Based on passage of time

 a. How quickly reinforcers work depends on
their timing

 Fixed Interval- Reinforcer given after set period of time.
Ex.: Weekly pay.
Variable Interval- Reinforcer given randomly with passage of time.

b. Continuous. Used to “shape” new behaviors

Ex.: Surprise bonus based on time.

c. But continuous reinforcement is impractical
2. Based on behavior exhibited by the employee (team)

1. Costly 

Fixed Ratio- Reinforcers based on behaviors.

2. Not as effective in sustaining behavior
over time 

Variable Ratio- Reinforcers applied randomly after exhibition of 
behaviors.

Ex.: Piece rate pay.

37

Ex.: A company vacation to Hawaii for all employees after a new
 38 
contract landed; spot bonuses.

Summary of Theories of Motivation
View all these approaches as a “bag of tricks.” Alternatives to
choose from, remembering that all are not compatible.

Judge whether you believe each “works.” Rely on the scientific 
data presented, your experiences, and your common sense.

Evaluate your prospects for successfully implementing each
one.

The question is not whether each of these approaches to
motivation works, but where and when they work best.
